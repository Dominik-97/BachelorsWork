	abstract = {The gift from an anthropological perspective differs from the rigid civil notion of donation, which presupposes an unilateral, gratuitous transfer from one person to another. The anthropological notion of the gift includes all gratuitous transfers, either material or non-material. Therefore, the relation between the anthropological notion of the gift and the legal notion of donation is one of inclusion. However, limitations imposed on donations in Roman law follow the same logic of the legal limitations on other gratuitous transfers such as the ones prohibited by leges sumptuaria. In this article I will analyze the reasons behind the legal interdictions in Roman law on some gratuitous spending, including donations between spouses, the ones prohibited by Lex cincia de donis et muneribus and by leges sumptuaria, interdictions that deal with the anthropological function of the gift in the greco-roman world.},

Scholars who work on the subject are increasingly being asked to conduct research in an interdisciplinary manner whereby Roman law is not merely seen as a set of abstract concepts devoid of any background, but as a body of law which operated in a specific social, economic and cultural context. This context-based, 'law and society' approach to the study of Roman law is an exciting new field which legal historians must address. This interdisciplinary collection focuses on three larger themes which have emerged from these studies: Roman legal thought the interaction between legal theory and legal practice and the relationship between law and economics.},
